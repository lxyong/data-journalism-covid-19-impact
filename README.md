# Data Journalism - Covid-19 Impact
This repository contains the dataset, documentation and Tableau workbook for the data journalism project.

In this project, I used the skills learned in data visualization to create a piece of data journalism about where the worst coronavirus situation in the world is.
I've presented the findings within 15 minutes to communicate important messages about the impact of the disease across the world.
 
## Scenario
You work for a global public health body, and it has asked you to produce a piece of data journalism on, “Where is the coronavirus situation the worst?” to be published on the agency’s website to coincide with an important press conference.

## Data
The data source is available [here](/02-Data-Prep/a-owid-covid-data.zip). It is from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), a great resource for data and visualizations with a mission to “..make progress against the world’s largest problems.”
The Data Dictionary is available [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-codebook.csv).

## Applied Skills
Data Wrangling, Data Exploration, Data Visualization, and Data Storytelling.

## Tableau
The [Tableau workbook](/03-Communication/Data%20Journalism%20-%20Covid-19%20Impact.twbx) containing the stories and workbook of the Covid-19 impact analysis. See the web version [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alex.yong/viz/DataJournalism-Covid-19Impact/Covid-19Story).
